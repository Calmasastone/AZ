This experimental technical task will let you know what skills do I have in Oracle SQL Developer, Python, Excel, Power BI and how I’m thinking as well

Task_1: We need to increase salaries for our employees depending on their work experience in our company and show the difference between salaries in previous period and future one by departments. I took 01.01.2009 as the current data (for example) 
Task_2: We’d find out employees distribution by work experience in our company (how many of them work less than one year, more than 1 year, more than 3 years, more than 5 years)

My Tactic
1.	I need to unite data from Database, fix nulls if I’ll meet them and then export it as an Excel file
2.	I’ve to find out the employees who worked less than 1y, more than 1y, more than 3y and more than 5y then I’ll increase their salaries depending on work experience. If hire_date (h_d) < 1y I’ll change nothing, if h_d > 1y then increase current salary by +5%, h_d > 3y => +10%, h_d > 5 years => +15%. Export 2 tables: 'Difference' and 'Work experience'
3.	Make better format in Excel and calculate something if needs for the following graphs
4.	Visualize salary difference by departments and show how long are the employees in company
5.	Upload result into GitHub and pin the link to your portfolio

* Of course, I could do calculation in Excel instead of Python, but in this case, I’d like to show you that I understand Python as well 
In another case if I’ll see that it’s better/faster to use Excel of course I’ll use it
